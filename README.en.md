# chatavion
Messaging system over DNS

WARNING! THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL, HIGHLY UNSTABLE PROJECT. 
IT SHOULD BE USED ONLY ON A DEDICATED VIRTUAL MACHINE. 
CONTRIBUTIONS ARE WELCOME.

Chatavion is a messaging system working only over DNS.
It may be used on almost every public Wi-Fi network, without authentication or payment. 
It was made to chat on (expensive) airplane networks for free, and it did work!

(I'm translating, I should be done soon... Please be patient, or learn French!)
